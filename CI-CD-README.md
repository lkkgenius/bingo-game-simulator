- **Security Maintenance**: Update security configurations and check compliance
- **Repository Cleanup**: Clean up repository and suggest optimizations

**Triggers:**
- Monthly scheduled runs (1st of each month)
- Manual trigger

## Code Quality Tools

### ESLint Configuration (`.eslintrc.js`)

- **Purpose**: JavaScript linting and code style enforcement
- **Rules**: Configured for ES2021, browser and Node.js environments
- **Security**: Includes rules to prevent dangerous patterns like `eval()`
- **Globals**: Defines game-specific global variables

### JSHint Configuration (`.jshintrc`)

- **Purpose**: Additional JavaScript quality checks
- **Features**: Strict mode checking, undefined variable detection
- **Compatibility**: ES6+ support with browser and Node.js environments

## Security Scanning

### Security Scanner (`security-scan.js`)

Automated security vulnerability scanner that checks for:

- **Dangerous Functions**: `eval()`, `Function()`, unsafe `setTimeout`/`setInterval`
- **DOM Manipulation**: Unsafe `innerHTML`, `document.write` usage
- **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Location manipulation, unsafe protocols
- **Sensitive Data**: Hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens
- **Information Disclosure**: Excessive console logging, security TODOs

**Severity Levels:**
- **High**: Critical security issues that must be fixed
- **Medium**: Important issues that should be addressed
- **Low**: Minor issues for consideration

## Performance Testing

### Performance Regression Tests (`performance-regression.test.js`)

Monitors performance to prevent degradation:

- **Game Initialization**: Must complete within 100ms
- **Move Calculation**: Must complete within 50ms
- **Line Detection**: Must complete within 30ms
- **Board Rendering**: Must complete within 20ms
- **Algorithm Switching**: Must complete within 25ms
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors memory consumption
- **Lighthouse Scores**: Maintains performance baselines

### Lighthouse Integration

- **Performance Audits**: Automated Lighthouse testing
- **Mobile Testing**: Mobile-specific performance validation
- **Baseline Scores**: Maintains minimum performance thresholds
- **Regression Detection**: Alerts on performance degradation

## Deployment Process

### GitHub Pages Deployment

**Automatic Deployment:**
1. Triggered on push to `main` branch
2. Runs all tests and quality checks
3. Optimizes files for production
4. Removes test files and development artifacts
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages

**Optimization Steps:**
- CSS minification
- Test file removal
- Cache header configuration
- Security header setup

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
# Build and test locally
npm run build

# Deploy (if all checks pass)
npm run deploy
```

## Local Development

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm start
```

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:performance
npm run test:security

# Run code quality checks
npm run lint
npm run quality
```

### Pre-commit Checks

```bash
# Run full CI pipeline locally
npm run ci
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### GitHub Actions Notifications

- **Success**: Green checkmarks on commits and PRs
- **Failure**: Red X marks with detailed error logs
- **Warnings**: Yellow warnings for non-critical issues

### Performance Monitoring

- **Lighthouse Reports**: Generated on every deployment
