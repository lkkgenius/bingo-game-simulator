# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the security issues identified by the GitHub Actions Comprehensive Security Audit. The audit has flagged multiple security concerns that need systematic resolution to ensure the Bingo game simulator meets modern web security standards and best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all hardcoded secrets and sensitive data patterns to be eliminated from the codebase, so that no credentials or sensitive information are exposed in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security scan runs THEN the system SHALL NOT find any API keys, passwords, tokens, or private keys in the codebase
2. WHEN checking for hardcoded credentials THEN the system SHALL return zero matches for common secret patterns
3. IF any configuration requires sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or secure configuration methods
4. WHEN scanning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded authentication credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want the application to have proper Content Security Policy implementation, so that I am protected from XSS attacks and other injection vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTML page loads THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive Content Security Policy header
2. WHEN inline scripts are used THEN the system SHALL use proper nonce or hash-based CSP directives
3. WHEN external resources are loaded THEN the system SHALL only allow trusted domains in the CSP
4. IF CSP violations occur THEN the system SHALL log them for security monitoring
5. WHEN the CSP is validated THEN the system SHALL pass all security policy checks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want all dangerous code patterns and vulnerable functions to be eliminated or properly secured, so that the application is not susceptible to code injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for dangerous functions THEN the system SHALL NOT use eval(), Function() constructor, or setTimeout/setInterval with strings
2. WHEN DOM manipulation is performed THEN the system SHALL use safe methods instead of innerHTML where possible
3. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs using the existing SecurityUtils
4. IF dangerous patterns are necessary THEN the system SHALL implement proper security controls and validation
5. WHEN the vulnerability scan runs THEN the system SHALL report zero high-severity issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all third-party dependencies and external resources to be properly validated and secured, so that the application doesn't introduce security risks through external code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external scripts are loaded THEN the system SHALL use integrity checks (SRI) where possible
2. WHEN third-party resources are included THEN the system SHALL only use HTTPS sources
3. WHEN package.json is present THEN the system SHALL NOT contain suspicious or malicious scripts
4. IF external dependencies are required THEN the system SHALL validate their security status
5. WHEN the dependency check runs THEN the system SHALL pass all security validations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow secure coding practices and maintain good code quality, so that security vulnerabilities are minimized through proper code structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint security rules are applied THEN the system SHALL pass all security-focused linting checks
2. WHEN code complexity is analyzed THEN the system SHALL NOT have overly complex functions that could hide security issues
3. WHEN file permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL NOT have executable JavaScript files
4. IF hidden files exist THEN the system SHALL only contain necessary configuration files
5. WHEN security linting runs THEN the system SHALL have zero security-related errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want comprehensive security reporting and monitoring, so that I can track security improvements and identify new issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed security reports
2. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity level
3. WHEN security improvements are made THEN the system SHALL track and document the changes
4. IF new security issues arise THEN the system SHALL alert through the monitoring workflow
5. WHEN security reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include actionable recommendations
